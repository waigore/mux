# mux docs

This built-in skill helps the agent answer questions about **mux** (Coding Agent Multiplexer) without dumping the entire docs into context.

## How to use

### Prefer: read the bundled docs snapshot (recommended)

This skill bundles an **offline snapshot of the mux docs** under `references/docs/`.

Why prefer the bundled snapshot?

1. The docs tree below is guaranteed to match what’s embedded.
2. It’s more likely to match *your installed mux version* (the live site may be ahead).

To read a specific page:

```ts
agent_skill_read_file({
  name: "mux-docs",
  filePath: "references/docs/config/models.mdx",
});
```

### Fallback: fetch the live docs (for newer features)

If the bundled docs don’t mention something (or you suspect the docs site has newer info), use `web_fetch`:

```ts
web_fetch({ url: "https://mux.coder.com/config/models" });
web_fetch({ url: "https://mux.coder.com/agents" });
```

#### Docs tree (auto-generated)

Use this index to find a page's:

- **Docs route** (for `web_fetch`)
- **Embedded file path** (for `agent_skill_read_file`)

<!-- END DOCS_TREE -->

1. Read the docs navigation (source of truth for which pages exist):

```ts
agent_skill_read_file({ name: "mux-docs", filePath: "references/docs/docs.json" });
```

2. Read a specific page by path (mirrors `docs/` in the mux repo):

- `/agents` → `references/docs/agents/index.mdx`
- `/config/models` → `references/docs/config/models.mdx`
- `/runtime` → `references/docs/runtime/index.mdx`

```ts
agent_skill_read_file({
  name: "mux-docs",
  filePath: "references/docs/config/models.mdx",
});
```

Notes:

- Many pages are `.mdx`; some are `.../index.mdx`.
- Images are not embedded; you may see `/img/...` references.

## When to use

Use this skill when the user asks how mux works (workspaces, runtimes, agents, models, hooks, keybinds, etc.).
